# Financial Agreement
### Context

>This agreement defines how root-systems handles money as a [pod](https://github.com/enspiral/os-book/blob/master/en/levels_of_organising.md#pod), specifically any funds collectively held in our bank accounts. Our goal is to make financial flows to and from the pod as transparent as possible and in a manner that allows for members to have a balance of **security, flexibility and opportunity** in how much remuneration they receive.

>This is version two of our financial agreement. We learned a **lot** from the first and overall deem it a success. 

>Things that worked:

>- We never had to negotiate. We all knew we were paid the same. 
- When Greg joined all he had to do was read our agreement and say he agreed... that easy!
- Our pay went up and down based on how well our business was going.

>Things that didn't go so well:

>- We built the system to reward software development, but other activity types were not financially valued.
- The base salary assumed we were all working full-time. In reality we get sick and want to take leave. 
- As we paid people based on what they did, rather then what they intended to do, we had to make relatively large assumptions about our outgoings when looking at cash flow forecasts.

>In our next iteration of the model we want to experiment with the idea of paying members based on what they **say** they are going to do, rather then what they actually do. This may sound strange - but its actually exactly what a salary is! The difference is that we allow members to define a granular collection of activity types to determine their pay. Our hypothesis is that this gives us the benefits of having people on salary  (predicabale outgoings and intent) while maintaining the flexibility of our current model (pay increases with company success)

> At least thats the idea ;)
