# Financial Agreement

###Context

This agreement defines how root-systems handles money as a pod, specifically any funds collectively held in virtual accounts within any venture of Enspiral. Our goal is to make financial flows to and from the pod as transparent as possible and in a manor that allows for members to have a balance of **security, flexability and opportunity** in how much renumeration they recieve.

##The Buffer
The buffer is what enables us to provide security to members, it is cash in the bank. It smooths out the feast-famine cycle that comes with doing contract/project based work. A unit of buffer is the sum of how much we take out of the pod as renumeration in a month. In general the more buffer we have the less we need to focus on making money.

###Buffer targets
Our buffer target is 3 months worth of our collective renumeration. To break this into scale we have 4 states/levels:

 - no buffer
 - 1 buffer
 - 2 buffer
 - 3 buffer

 These levels are used as event control points. 

###Buffer events
Moving up or down the scale is seen as an event which will have side effects. Side effects may be defined in other agreements and/or commitments. Buffer tranistions should be recorded in a commitment detailing the side-effects in a migration style format. Side-effects should have links to any pertaining information. eg:
