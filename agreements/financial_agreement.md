# Financial Agreement

###Context

This agreement defines how root-systems handles money as a pod, specifically any funds collectively held in virtual accounts within any venture of Enspiral. Our goal is to make financial flows to and from the pod as transparent as possible and in a manor that allows for members to have a balance of **security, flexability and opportunity** in how much renumeration they recieve.

##The Buffer
The buffer is what enables us to provide security to members, it is cash in the bank. It smooths out the feast-famine cycle that comes with doing contract/project based work. A unit of buffer is the sum of how much we take out of the pod as renumeration in a month. In general the more buffer we have the less we need to focus on making money.

###Buffer targets
Our buffer target is 4 months worth of our collective renumeration. To break this into scale we have 5 states/levels:

 - no buffer
 - 1 buffer
 - 2 buffer
 - 3 buffer
 - 4 buffer

These levels are used as event control points. 

###Buffer events
Moving up or down the scale is seen as an event which will have side effects. Side effects may be defined in other agreements and/or commitments. Buffer tranistions should be recorded in a commitment detailing the side-effects in a migration style format. Side-effects should have links to any pertaining information. eg:

```markdown
##Buffer 1

###Up
- [side effects that occur when buffer moves to a level 2 buffer](www.link.to.it).

###Down
- [side effects that occur when buffer 1is moving down to no buffer](www.link.to.it).
```

###Buffer as control lever (Whats the point of all this?)
By coupling several factors to buffer events we can create a self regulating system. The intent is that as the buffer increases so to does the money flowing away from the pod. These are the scaling money out flows and do not incude fixed costs such as space hire and saas tools.


##Income
The pods funds come from the following sources:

###Contracting/Bodyshopping
We sell our time to work as directed - often augementing an existing team. We charge by the hour.

###Brownfields project work
We manage and deliver a project that is extending/refining an existing code base. May be charged by the hour or by negociated value.

###Greenfields project work
We manage and deliver a project with a new code base.

###Discovery workshops/Code audits
Typically a days work these are tools we use to deepen our and the clients understanding of the requirments.

###Retainers/Maintanance Agreements
A fixed monthly sum paying for us to update, refactor and slowly develop the code base.

##Expenses
Money flowing away from the pod happens as follows

###Fixed costs
Paying for our operation cost has the highest priority and happens beforo paying individuals.

###Livelihood
Eating together

###Base renumeration
The base renumeration is a fixed sum that all members recieve. It can go up as buffer levels are developed. It has the second highest priority.

###Income share
An income share can be agreed to be given to an individual member as a means of topping up their base income. The income share is typically 20% of the billable rate multiplied by the hours worked - unless agreed otherwise. An income share can also be agreed internally between members by unanamous agreement.

###Contribution to the common
Contribution to the common is done as a percentage of total revenue of the pod/manth. Unless agreed otherwise this is a scaling amount of between 0-20% depending on the buffer level.

###Contribution to other pods
Contribution to other pods is done as a percentage of total revenue of the pod/month.

###Payment for services rendered
Paying for contractors by the hour.
