# Working with Root Systems as a contractor

## Pay

* Contractor receives 65% of charge out rate to client
* Root Systems receives 35% of charge out rate

The 35% Root Systems receives is to cover the risk involved with taking on a contract. Shit can happen and all legal responsibility is held by Root Systems.

It also covers the cost of finding contracts. We can spend a lot of unpaid time working with clients to find work. We also work with Golden Pandas and [pay them a retainer + commission every month](./golden-pandas.md).

## Invoicing

You are expected to send an invoice to Root Systems Limited at the first working day of every month.

Invoices are to be dated as last day of the month worked. E.g if you're invoicing for the month of May, make sure the invoice is dated 31 May.

Please send your invoices to rsaccounts@enspiral.com and cc in root-systems-coordinators@enspiral.com

Invoices will be paid by the 20th of every month.

## Time Tracking

We recommend using [Toggl](https://toggl.com). Please ask a Root Systems member to be invited to our Toggl team.

## Expenses

If you have any expenses that need claiming, include this in your monthly invoice along with the related receipts.

## Ongoing work

Do you enjoy working with Root Systems and would like to work with us more, or become a member?
We're still in the process of figuring out how we invite people into Root Systems, but please feel free to contact anyone in the team about this :)
