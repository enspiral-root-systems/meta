# Coordination Agreement

Root Systems believes in having processes over the enforcement of rules with regards to coordination and time management. Good processes alleviate the need for rule-abiding and enforcement.

## Scheduling

Root Systems members schedule their time two weeks in advance, based on the [Scheduling Guide](../guides/scheduling.md) and the various [Activity Types](./activity-types.md).

## Daily Stand-up

Members also meet at 10am each morning during the week for stand-up, a quick meeting during which everyone surfaces what they have been working on, what they will be working on, and any blocks they may be encountering.
