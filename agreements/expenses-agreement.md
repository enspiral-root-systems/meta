# Expenses Agreement

As a worker-owned business Root Systems members all have the ability to claim expenses relating to the operation of the business.

## This may include:

 - Technical equipment (laptops, keyboards, etc...)
 - Office equipment (coffee machine, chairs, desk, lights, etc...)
 - Office space rent
 - Retreats and Away days (travel, food and accommodation)
 - Event expenses (tickets, food, etc...)

 - Travel expenses (transport, hotels, flights, etc...)
 - SAAS tools (google, toggl, loomio, xero, etc...)
 - Memberships (Enspiral)

## Accounting for expenses

Expenses fall into two categories:

 - Team expense
 - Member expense

### Team expense

These are expenses that are accounted for out of core funds and facilitated by the Coordinators. The list at the bottom of this agreement defines ongoing Team expenses that we do not need raise a decision for. Beyond this any member can raise a proposal via Loomio to add another Team expense (one-off or on-going). Team expenses will be accounted for out of our operational budget in Xero.

### Member expense

Any Member can expense off any items they identify as being a business expense. Coordinators will facilitate this to provide support and understanding of what constitutes a business expense. Member expenses will be accounted for through deducting the expense minus GST from their internal account.
