# Optimi / Root Systems Agreement

We have a combination retainer and hours cap with ops. That is to say that Ops will receive their retainer every month regardless of whether they have needed to work the number of hours agreed. The cap is in place to give ops some flexibility should they need it. The expectation is that we will be notified that we have used all our retainer, but that Ops does not need to stop work and wait for a response from us. The Cap is a hard limit we will not pay more than.
