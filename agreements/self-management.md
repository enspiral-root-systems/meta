# Self-Management Agreement

Root Systems believes in having agreed processes to coordinate as a group via commitments and hold us each accountable to our commitments. Good processes alleviate the need for rules and enforcers.

## Coordination

### Strategy

Root Systems [Coordinators](../roles/coordinator.md) plan our long-term Team coordination strategy:

- who is working on what Team project, and
- what role on each project is expected.

If a Root Systems Member desires a change in project or role, they should direct the request to the Coordinators.

### Scheduling

Root Systems Members schedule, based on the [Scheduling Guide](../guides/scheduling.md) and the various [Activity Types](./activity-types.md),

- 3 months in advance their rough intent for days on Personal or Team.
- 2 weeks in advance their clear plan for projects on Team days.

This scheduling should describe:

- what days does a Member intend to be Personal or Team?
- what projects does a Member plan to work on Team days?

Members will update their schedule to reflect changes they make due to unforeseen circumstances. For example: getting sick.

## Accountability

### Daily Stand-up

Members meet at 10am each morning during the week for stand-up, a quick meeting for surfacing:

- how are you feeling (checkin)?
- what did you say you were going to do on the last working day?
- what did you actually do on the last working day?
- what are you going to do today?
- are you blocked by anything?

This should be done remotely via Slack if Members are unable to be there in person.

### Time Tracking

Members track time worked on any Team project.
