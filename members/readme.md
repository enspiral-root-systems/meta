Dan loves to learn and fix things. Tinkering and evolving a plan to deal with a problem so as to create the most robust solution gives him immense satisfaction. In 2014 he attended Enspiral Dev Academy, leveling up as a developer. This built on the communication, project management and solution design theory he learned while studying Architecture and working as a disability healthcare provisioner. During the last decade he's travelled to many countries, lived in three, learnt Swedish and fell in love with the complexity and diversity of our world.

Iain is based in Wellington. He is interested in basketball and archaeology in Upper Mesopotamia, specifically tell sites, formed from the accumulated remains of people living on the same site for hundreds or thousands of years.

Sarah is a Wellington-based human whose life experience to date includes coding, starting a local food buying group, and growing another, smaller human inside her belly. Snuggling up with her daughter under a crochet blanket with a hot toddy under the stars is her idea of a really excellent time. Sometimes she turns into a sacred grove of trees that can see clearly through darkness, smoke, dust and fog.
