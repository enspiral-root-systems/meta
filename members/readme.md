### [Dan Lewis](https://github.com/agentlewis)

Dan loves to learn and fix things. Tinkering and evolving a plan to deal with a problem so as to create the most robust solution gives him immense satisfaction. In 2014 he attended Enspiral Dev Academy, leveling up as a developer. This built on the communication, project management and solution design theory he learned while studying Architecture and working as a disability healthcare provisioner. During the last decade he's travelled to many countries, lived in three, learnt Swedish and fell in love with the complexity and diversity of our world.
