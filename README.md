## Purpose (Why)

Our purpose is to imagine and cultivate local replicable life-support systems for interdependent abundance.

## Strategy (How)

We primarily do tech consulting to bootstrap our more aspirational outcomes.

Want to work with us? Here's an example of our _ideal_ external consulting contract:

- You, the client, have an existing source of revenue and want to build a new or replace an old software product or service.
- We start with a series of collaborative discovery workshops to focus and clarify the problem we're solving with you.
- We connect with relevant stakeholders to refine the scope into clear and actionable [job stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.layvu3kpi), preferably with accompanying [executable specifications](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/executableSpecifications.htm).
- We begin our iterative development process, charging hourly rates as fuel to push the vehicle forward.
- We continue to check back in with stakeholders at each relevant cycle, to ensure our work matches the needs of your business.

Meanwhile, internally we spend our available energy to:

- Improve the toolbelt we carry with us in our work (our open source stack, e.g. [`cat-stack`](https://github.com/enspiral-root-systems/cat-stack), [`dogstack`](https://github.com/iainkirkpatrick/dogstack), [`inu`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/inu), [`vas`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/vas), and more)
- Plan our economic needs, wants, and offers together (i.e. selling services, saving money, buying food), to ensure sustainable livelihood for all our members.
- Cultivate ecosystems of interoperable life-support products, [platforms](http://platformcoop.net/), and protocols (e.g. [Open App Ecosystem](https://github.com/open-app/core) -> [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/doing-more-together-together-seeding-a-collaborative-technology-alliance-82243ea30d41), [Secure Scuttlebutt Consortium](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz), [Value Flows](https://valueflo.ws))
