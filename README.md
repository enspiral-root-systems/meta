# Enspiral Root Systems

## Purpose (Why)

Our purpose is to imagine and cultivate local replicable life-support systems for interdependent abundance.

## Action (How)

We will:

- plan our economic needs, wants, and offers together (i.e. selling services, saving money, buying food)
- cultivate a common stack (e.g. [`cat-stack`](https://github.com/enspiral-root-systems/cat-stack))
- cultivate ecosystem of living life-support apps (e.g. [Open App Ecosystem](https://github.com/open-app/core) -> [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/doing-more-together-together-seeding-a-collaborative-technology-alliance-82243ea30d41))
- cultivate interoperable protocols (e.g. [Value Flows](https://valueflo.ws))
