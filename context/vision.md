# Vision

## Interdependent abundance

We wish to work on what we want to work on and don't do what we don't want to do.

By sharing our values, we hope to connect our wants and offers with those around us for explicit interdependence.

## Always be learning and teaching

We aim to always be learning and always be teaching.

We strive for nurturing environments for creativity, so everyone is supported to excel on their personal journey.

## Life support infrastructure

We share all our work with others, building up a pool of re-usable modules, knowledge systems, and living ecosystems, and sharing them virally to others who might benefit.

We want to live in a world with ubiquitous, location-agnostic localisation that supports all living beings.
