- [check-in](#weekly): every week
- [retreat](#retreat): every quarter

## Check-in

Every week we meet over lunch to check-in about our current happenings.

This is a safe space for us to share what's up with each other. What you say here, stays here.

## Retreat

Every quarter we meet somewhere out-of-town to catch up with the bigger picture.

This is a chill environment for us to relax and spend time with each other. Maybe we gather some retrospective feelings and set some forward-thinking strategy.
