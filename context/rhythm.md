## Check-in

Every week we meet over lunch to check-in about our current happenings - mental states, personal events, lives in general.

This is a safe space for us to share what's up with each other. What you say here, stays here.

## Away day

Every month, or as desired, we meet somewhere out of our normal space, to jam on group activities.

This is a productive space to coordinate and swarm on anything that needs to be done.

## Retreat

Every quarter we meet somewhere out-of-town for 2-3 days to catch up with the bigger picture.

This is a chill environment for us to relax and spend time with each other. Maybe we gather some retrospective feelings and set some forward-thinking strategy.

## [Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting)

Every year we spend 4-7 days somewhere out-of-town to set our annual big picture strategy.

This is basically a long retreat with a specific focus on large-scale business planning and coordination.

To comply with the [Companies Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0105/latest/whole.html#DLM320614) we also use this meeting as our Annual General Meeting for shareholders (all of our shareholders are members)

We follow [this format](agm.md) for the formal part of the meeting.
