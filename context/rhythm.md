## [Check-in](#check-in)

Every week we meet over lunch to check-in about our current happenings.

This is a safe space for us to share what's up with each other. What you say here, stays here.

## [Away day](#away-day)

Every month, or as desired, we meet somewhere out of our normal space, to jam on group activities.

This is a productive space to coordinate and swarm on anything that needs to be done.

## [Retreat](#retreat)

Every quarter we meet somewhere out-of-town for 2-3 days to catch up with the bigger picture.

This is a chill environment for us to relax and spend time with each other. Maybe we gather some retrospective feelings and set some forward-thinking strategy.

## [Annual General Meeting (AGM)](#agm)

Every year we spend 4-7 days somewhere out-of-town to set our annual big picture strategy.

This is basically a long retreat with a specific focus on large-scale business planning and coordination.
