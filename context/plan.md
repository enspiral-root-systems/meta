# Root Systems plan

[Our Long Term Vision](./vision.md) is broad and we do not have a concrete idea of what this utopia/these utopias might be.

Rather we have identified a rough plan for how to achieve some specific goals.

## An Ecosystem of Livelihood Pods

Pods are great by themselves, but are by themselves rather fragile. This is a byproduct of forming a group around a key activity or skill (a group of developers, designers, engineers, chefs, etc... typically services). As such there is a need to interface with other pods that have an alternative focus/service. Forming service agreements between the pods allows for each pod to de-risk by outsourcing its dependencies. This can be further established by having revenue share agreements - ideally bi-directional. That way each pod thrives or suffers together. This dependency and risk-sharing brings the pods closer together.

If we imagine this at scale there could be dozens of interrelated pods that act autonomously, conduct some activities together, provide services to each other, provide services together to non-pods and establish a Communal Basic Income between them.

Developing an ecosystem of pods will allow far greater innovation while maintaining security. Pods will have to negotiate how each spends its time, e.g. can a pod just go on hiatus and still receive a CBI? We will work it out when we get there ;)

To deal with the problems of coordination and communication we will need a clear protocol that each pod needs to meet to be in the Ecosystem of Pods. This protocol may involve pod structure, communications channels, cadences, reporting and required tools.

At the moment Root Systems, Golden Pandas, Optimi and Protozoa are all pods working to establish the Alpha Protocol of an [Ecosystem](./ecosystem.md) of Pods.

## Software for Our Supply Network

The supply network is the combination of our commodity and services markets. It is not designed or governed by many organisations and states. It has evolved with us over time - most likely really taking off with the agrarian and industrial age.

A supply chain is a slice through the supply network. It is a conceived series of processes that make up the steps of the delivery of a service and/or product to an end human. Supply chains are always anchored by a collection of humans making up a market providing demand. It is the informal, emergent coordination of supply and demand.

This could be the production of materials, processing/combining of materials, breaking up of goods into smaller units, delivery of goods, etc... You can imagine that every product or service has a supply chain story of how it came to the human consuming/receiving it.  

Except you generally won't know the story. The various organisations and traders in the chain act with a protectionist mindset, not sharing/passing on information about the chain in an attempt to maintain a "market edge". Though this in theory works, our examination is that in the long run it is harmful to humanity as a whole.

Our intervention is to develop a protocol to standardise the data shape to share information between supply chain actors. This protocol will allow for a new type of coordination, one more intentional. The market will be able to communicate their requirements to the supply network and find value-aligned suppliers to meet the demand. The supply network will also be able to communicate with various markets to find out more specifically what the demand is, this way coordinating availability with the demand.

This will lead to a transparent supply network, where anyone may start supplying and be informed of what the market demands.

We will end up with a supply network that is more sustainably human, and less a cold and indifferent machine.
