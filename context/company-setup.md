# Company Setup - WIP

## Company Registration in NZ

* Shareholders
* Directors

## Bank Account

- Kiwibank Business banking
  - We were required to set up 'profiles' for each shareholder with Kiwibank before opening an account for the business. This meant needing to show / send through some identification. A profile is also required if a person wants to have personal banking with Kiwibank - in practice 3 of 4 shareholders already had profiles.
- 1 director sign
    - With team members regularly overseas we decided to have only one director to sign important documents.

    - Buffer
