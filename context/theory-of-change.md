# Root Systems Theory of Change

[Our Long Term Vision](./vision.md) is broad and we do not have a concrete idea of what this Utopia might be. Rather we have Identified two (Theories of Change)[] that we beleive and pursue as steps towards this.

## An Ecosystem of Livelihood Pods

(Pods)[] are great by themselves, but are by themselves rather fragile. This is a by product of forming a group around a key activity or skill (a group of developers, designers, engineers, chefs, etc... typically services). As such there is a need to interface with other pods that have an alternative focus/service. Forming service agreements between the pods allows for each pod to derisk its external dependancy. This can be further established by having revenue share agreements - ideally bi-directional. That way each pod thrives or suffers together. This dependancy and risk sharing brings the pods closer together.

If we imaging this at scale there could be dozens of interelated pods that act autonomously, conduct some activities together, provide services to each other, provide services together to non pods and establish a Communal Basic Pod Income between them.

Developing an ecosystem of pods will allow for far greater innovation while maintaining security. Pods will have to negociate how each spend there time. eg can a pod just go on hiatus and still recieve a CBPI? We will work it out when we get there ;)

To deal with the problems of coordination and communication we will need a clear Protocol that each pod needs to meet to be in the Ecosystem of Pods. This may involeve pod structure, comunications channels, cadences, reporting and required tools.

At the moment Root Systems, Golden Pandas, Optize and Protoza are all pods working to establish the Alpha Protocol of an Ecosystem of Pods.
