# Working With Us

Our approach to building great software is centered around design thinking and agile rhythms.s

Here's an example of our _ideal_ external consulting contract:

- You, the client, have an existing source of revenue and want to build a new or replace an old software product or service.
- We start with a series of collaborative discovery workshops to focus and clarify the problem we're solving with you.
- We connect with relevant stakeholders to refine the scope into clear and actionable [job stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.layvu3kpi), preferably with accompanying [executable specifications](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/executableSpecifications.htm).
- We begin our iterative development process, charging hourly rates as fuel to push the vehicle forward.
- We continue to check back in with stakeholders at each relevant cycle, to ensure our work matches the needs of your business.
