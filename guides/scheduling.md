# Scheduling Guide for Planning Your Future Hours #

Each Root Systems' Member will have an individual scheduling Google Calendar, i.e. "Dan's Planned Hours for Root Systems", which Optimi has set up for Members.

**To plan your upcoming schedule:** 
- Create a Day event
- For the name of the event, type in one of three options:
    - External
    - Internal
    - Personal
- The suggested guidelines for your schedule is: 3 days external, 1 day internal, and 1 day personal per week.
    
**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**
As these scheduled days are *planned*, **once created do not change these events**, even if you end up doing something different than what is planned. Your actual hours are captured via Toggl.
