## Director

### Purpose

The purpose of a director is to keep the business running long term (as opposed to a Coordinator) by managing risk and making sure progress is being made towards our strategic activities set at the [last retreat.](https://www.rootsystems.nz/context/rhythm.html#retreat)

### Tasks

* Hold coordinators to account
* Sign off all proposals and supporting coordinators to manage risk
* Making sure we are fulfilling all legal obligations under the [Companies Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0105/latest/DLM319570.html)
* Making sure contracts exist and are signed where appropriate
* Coordinate tax payments

### Principles

* The Directors follow the [advice process](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making#The_advice_process). This includes bubbling important decisions up to Members as a consensus decision if needed.

### Outcomes

### Constraints

### Rhythm

* [Monthly meeting](directors-meeting.md) with second director to discuss issues, finances and projects

## Change of directors
If a director would like to step down, [by law](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0105/latest/whole.html#DLM320800) a director must resign by letter to the listed Root Systems address

> A director of a company may resign office by signing a written notice of resignation and delivering it to the address for service of the company. The notice is effective when it is received at that address or at a later time specified in the notice.
